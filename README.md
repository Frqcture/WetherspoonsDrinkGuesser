# WetherspoonsDrinkGuesser

Basic IOS and Android App to guess what drink you ordered at wetherspoons based on how much you paid.
Currently restricted to 3 different wetherspoons in Birmingham however as I make more development I plan to automate the gathering of data so that I can use every drink in every wetherspoons across the uk (850+ locations).

Tech Stack:
- Javascript
- React Native
- Expo

Future Plans:
- Add functionality to track friends drinks and "compete"
- Add more data
