# WetherspoonsDrinkGuesser

Basic IOS and Android App to guess what drink you ordered at wetherspoons based on how much you paid.
Currently restricted to "The Figure of Eight" wetherspoons on Broad Street, Birmingham due to lack of data. When more data is added the k-Nearest algorithm will become better with a larger k-Value.

Tech Stack:
- Javascript
- React Native
- Expo

Future Plans:
- Add functionality to track friends drinks and "compete"
- Add more data
